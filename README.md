Additional Origins for the Minecraft Origins Mod
My Additional Origins:
-Zombie: with help from @Lily Arlatto
-Wither Skeleton
-Axolotl
-Vulpine (fox): inspired by Canine by @Ilovekatesomuch ඞ 
-Leporine (rabbit)
-Ovine (sheep)
-Phantom: much like the Origins version but can see farther while phasing underground
-Merling: much like the Origins version but can press G while under water to hold their breath for 5 minutes
-Feline: much like the Origins version but the mining restriction has been removed
-Blazeborn: much like the Origins version but is passive with other blaze
-Zombie: reverted zombie neutrality because it was bugged

Noteable Powers:
-The Zombie bites in melee combat, healing itself as it damages its enemy
-The Wither Skeleton inflicts the wither effect in melee combat
-The Axolotl can hold it's breath for 5 min on land. (Press G under water to hold your breath before you surface.)
-The Vulpine can turn invisible and "hide" for 30 seconds once every minute.
-The Leporine is naturally lucky.
-The Ovine can shear itself for one wool once per minute if it is holding shears.

Other Origins also included in this pack because I love them and think they fit:
-Bee by @breedo (with minor naming tweaks)
-Elytrian (replaces the Origins Elytrian) by @Defhunta 
-Canine by @Ilovekatesomuch ඞ  (with some minor power tweaks)
-Slimeling by @Jimothy (with minor naming tweaks)
-Enderian (replaces the Origins Enderian) by @Defhunta 

Updates:
-Blazeborn is now passive with other blaze but aggros other blaze if it initiates combat
-Reverted Zombie neutraility
 
If for any reason you don't want a particular origin in this pack you can go to:
"datapacks" ---> "additional" ---> "data" ---> "origins" ---> "origin_layers" and edit the origin.json file removing the origins you don't want. 
Similarly if you want the Origins version of the origins I edited, you can remove the "origin" folder in the same folder as "origin_layers" or edit the files in the folder as you see fit!
