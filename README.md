# Additional Origins:
Additional Origins datapack for the Minecraft Origins Mod

In order to use this datapack with the Origins Mod, simply download the additional.zip file and put in your minecraft world's datapacks folder. This requires the Origins Mod to work! Get the mod here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins

Check out the Origins Mod Discord Server for more datapacks or help here: https://discord.gg/9SXCFKjP

If for any reason you don't want a particular origin in this pack you can go to:
"additional" ---> "data" ---> "origins" ---> "origin_layers" and edit the origin.json file removing the origins you don't want. 

Similarly if you want the Origins version of the origins I edited, you can remove the "origin" folder in the same folder as "origin_layers" or remove the particular files in the folder as you see fit, while also updating the origin.json file as explained above by removing the origin you want the original of.
