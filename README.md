# Modified Origins from the Origins Mod:

**Feline:** the mining restriction has been removed

Flight - Sprinting while gliding will increase the Elytrians forward velocity, allowing launches off the ground like fireworks! This ability has a meter, which will slowly regenerate over time. Using this ability also consumes hunger over time. Made by @Defhunta

# Modifying my datapack

If for any reason you don't want a particular origin in this pack first unzip the datapack you are using then go to:
"additional" ---> "data" ---> "origins" ---> "origin_layers" and edit the origin.json file in the txt document editing software of your choice, such as Notepad or Notepad++. Simply delete the lines that include the origins you don't want. Delete the original zip file and keep the unzipped one that you edited. Be careful to leave the origin.json file in proper JSON format, pay particular close attention to the commas, there should be one after each origin name except the last one in the list. Here is an example of the file at the time of posting for reference:

	{
		"replace": false,	
		"origins":	
		[		
			"elytrian:elytrian",		
			"additional:merling",		
			"additional:zombie",		
			"additional:wither_skeleton",		
			"additional:axolotl",		
			"additional:phantom",		
			"additional:vulpine",		
			"additional:feline",		
			"additional:leporine",		
			"additional:ovine",		
			"additional:enderian",		
			"additional:blazeborn",		
			"bee:bee",
